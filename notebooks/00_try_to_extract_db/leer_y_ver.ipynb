Additionally, she also exhibited lack of efficacy while receiving beclometasone for skin rash; and a 29-year-old woman received ceftazidime, oseltamivir, cefotiam, azithromycin, diclofenac sodium and methylprednisolone during pregnancy, and received off-label treatment of azithromycin and oseltamivir for SARS-CoV-2 infection [&lt;EM&gt;not all routes and dosages stated&lt;/EM&gt;].&lt;BR /&gt;Case 1: The 34-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 0), who had a 37 week of pregnancy had come in contact with COVID-19 infected person on 10 January 2020. She developed a fever (37.3°C–37.5°C) on 18 January 2020 with onset of illness. She was started on lianhua qingwen and oral cefaclor 375mg twice daily. Her fever reduced but returned 2 days later. On 23 January, she reported a rash on her abdomen. She received topical beclometasone, but her rash did not respond and quickly spread to her whole body. Hence, she was given topical calamine. On 24 January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed with a nasopharyngeal swab, and she received off label therapy with oral azithromycin 500mg daily and oral oseltamivir 75mg twice daily and her lianhua qingwen was continued. On 27 January 2020, she was admitted to hospital. Laboratory tests were unremarkable except persistent fever, and new coronavirus pneumonia. Hence, she was given two doses of IV methylprednisolone 20mg daily for pneumonia. On 31 January 2020, she delivered a baby girl by cesarean section with a body weight of 3400g and Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. The nasopharyngeal swab of the baby and the maternal samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the baby developed a low-grade fever, lung infection and abdominal distension with lymphopaenia, but responded to antibiotics and was discharged. Subsequently, the woman received cefotiam [cefotiam hydrochloride], ornidazole and methylprednisolone. On 10 February 2020, her nasopharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.&lt;BR /&gt;Case 2: The 29-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0), who had a 36 week of pregnancy presented with chill, fever (37.6°C–38.5°C), nasal congestion and sore throat on 23 January 2020. She had come in contact with COVID-19 infected person on 16 January 2020. She had admitted to hospital for vaginal bleeding on 20 January 2020 and was discharged on 23 January 2020. She received diclofenac sodium suppositories on 24 January 2020, but her fever persisted. She was suspected to have COVID-19 infection. On 25 January, she was admitted to hospital and started receiving off-label treatment with oral oseltamivir 75mg daily and azithromycin along with lianhua qingwen, cefotiam and oral ceftazidime 2g daily. On 26 January, her nasopharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The chest CT showed multiple patchy infiltrates on the left side of the lung and IV methylprednisolone 20mg daily was added to her treatment on 29 January 2020. On 30 January 2020, vaginal bleeding recurred, and caesarean section was performed at 37 weeks gestation. The new-born weighed 2890g with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 minute and 5 minutes, respectively. The woman received cefotiam [cefotiam hydrochloride], ornidazole and methylprednisolone. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the new-born's nasopharyngeal swab and maternal samples. However, the new-born developed mild neonatal pneumonia and lymphopaenia and was treated with antibiotics, showing good clinical responses. Later, the woman tested negative and was discharged.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&amp;quot;In this article, we describe 2 physicians with COVID-19 during the third trimester of gestation&amp;quot;. &amp;quot; The rash did not respond to topical beclomethasone...She was given topical calamine&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Despite the use of diclofenac sodium suppositories, fever persisted.&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Her nasopharyngeal swab turned out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 26 January.

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption. No further recurrence of erythema was observed.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&amp;quot;We report a case of erythro-papular drug eruption caused by [fosravuconazole].&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He had experienced a drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He started systemic treatment with cefaclor…oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day.

       "0   In a case series, two women were described of whom, a 34-year-old woman received cefaclor, calamine, azithromycin, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone and beclomethasone during pregnancy and received off-label treatment of azithromycin, oseltamivir for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, she also exhibited lack of efficacy while receiving beclometasone for skin rash; and a 29-year-old woman received ceftazidime, oseltamivir, cefotiam, azithromycin, diclofenac sodium and methylprednisolone during pregnancy, and received off-label treatment of azithromycin and oseltamivir for SARS-CoV-2 infection [<EM>not all routes and dosages stated</EM>].<BR />Case 1: The 34-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 0), who had a 37 week of pregnancy had come in contact with COVID-19 infected person on 10 January 2020. She developed a fever (37.3°C–37.5°C) on 18 January 2020 with onset of illness. She was started on lianhua qingwen and oral cefaclor 375mg twice daily. Her fever reduced but returned 2 days later. On 23 January, she reported a rash on her abdomen. She received topical beclometasone, but her rash did not respond and quickly spread to her whole body. Hence, she was given topical calamine. On 24 January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed with a nasopharyngeal swab, and she received off label therapy with oral azithromycin 500mg daily and oral oseltamivir 75mg twice daily and her lianhua qingwen was continued. On 27 January 2020, she was admitted to hospital. Laboratory tests were unremarkable except persistent fever, and new coronavirus pneumonia. Hence, she was given two doses of IV methylprednisolone 20mg daily for pneumonia. On 31 January 2020, she delivered a baby girl by cesarean section with a body weight of 3400g and Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. The nasopharyngeal swab of the baby and the maternal samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the baby developed a low-grade fever, lung infection and abdominal distension with lymphopaenia, but responded to antibiotics and was discharged. Subsequently, the woman received cefotiam [cefotiam hydrochloride], ornidazole and methylprednisolone. On 10 February 2020, her nasopharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.<BR />Case 2: The 29-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0), who had a 36 week of pregnancy presented with chill, fever (37.6°C–38.5°C), nasal congestion and sore throat on 23 January 2020. She had come in contact with COVID-19 infected person on 16 January 2020. She had admitted to hospital for vaginal bleeding on 20 January 2020 and was discharged on 23 January 2020. She received diclofenac sodium suppositories on 24 January 2020, but her fever persisted. She was suspected to have COVID-19 infection. On 25 January, she was admitted to hospital and started receiving off-label treatment with oral oseltamivir 75mg daily and azithromycin along with lianhua qingwen, cefotiam and oral ceftazidime 2g daily. On 26 January, her nasopharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The chest CT showed multiple patchy infiltrates on the left side of the lung and IV methylprednisolone 20mg daily was added to her treatment on 29 January 2020. On 30 January 2020, vaginal bleeding recurred, and caesarean section was performed at 37 weeks gestation. The new-born weighed 2890g with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 minute and 5 minutes, respectively. The woman received cefotiam [cefotiam hydrochloride], ornidazole and methylprednisolone. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the new-born's nasopharyngeal swab and maternal samples. However, the new-born developed mild neonatal pneumonia and lymphopaenia and was treated with antibiotics, showing good clinical responses. Later, the woman tested negative and was discharged.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;In this article, we describe 2 physicians with COVID-19 during the third trimester of gestation&quot;. &quot; The rash did not respond to topical beclomethasone...She was given topical calamine&quot;. &quot;Despite the use of diclofenac sodium suppositories, fever persisted.&quot; &quot; Her nasopharyngeal swab turned out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 26 January.

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.<BR />The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption.

Antibacterials with less than three delirium ADR reports were excluded.<BR />Antibacterials found to have significant Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs) for delirium were: ampicillin/sulbactam, azithromycin, cefaclor, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, cotrimoxazole, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, linezolid, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Ertapenem had the highest ROR (21.07; 95% CI 16.38, 27.10), and cefepime had the second highest ROR (9.8; 95% CI 6.37, 15.09).<BR />For most antibacterial classes, RORs were higher in older patients than in younger patients.<BR />The delirium reporting association with ampicillin/sulbactam was previously unknown, noted the authors. &quot;Antibiotic stewardship is needed to prevent delirium and to improve health outcomes,&quot; they concluded.  \n",

Subsequently, five of the 86 patients developed DHR in the form of angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, collapse, loss of consciousness, exanthema, pruritus or malaise following administration of ampicillin, amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, minor determinant mixture or penicilloyl polylysin for skin test (ST) or drug provocation test (DPT) [<EM>not all indications stated; dosages, routes, duration of treatments to reaction onsets and outcomes not stated</EM>].<BR />The patients were receiving cephalosporin treatment with ceftriaxone (16 patients), cefuroxime (14 patients), cefotaxime (5 patients), cefixime (2 patients), cefpodoxime (1 patient), cefepime (1 patient), ceftazidime (1 patient), cefatrizine (14 patients), cefaclor (5 patients), cefadroxil (1 patient) and cefazolin (26 patients). Subsequently, 81 of the 86 patients developed DHR secondary to the cephalosporins, and five patients developed DHR in the form of anaphylactic shock (2 patients), anaphylaxis (2 patients) and urticaria (1 patient) secondary to the cephalosporins. Hence, they underwent an allergy workup with ST or DPT. In 5 of the 86 patients, the ST were performed with cephalosporins at the dose of 2 mg/mL or penicillin reagents including penicilloyl polylysin, minor determinant mixture, amoxicillin or ampicillin at the dose of 20 mg/mL or benzylpenicillin 10000 UI/mL. Allergic work-up showed positive results for ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefatrizine, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefazolin, minor determinant mixture, penicilloyl polylysin, benzylpenicillin [penicillin-G], amoxicillin or ampicillin, and negative result for minor determinant mixture, penicilloyl-polylysin, benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefepime, ceftazidime or cefotaxime.

For the treatment of COVID-19, they received off-label therapy with a combination of antibacterials, antivirals and unspecified corticosteroids. They received antibacterials including cefoperazone/tazobactam [Cefoperazone sodium/tazobactam sodium], azithromycin, cefaclor, ceftriaxone [Ceftriaxone sodium], cefepime; antivirals including oseltamivir, peramivir and unspecified interferons. Following this combined treatment, all women had uneventful recovery from COVID-19. After recovery from COVID-19, 1 woman chose induced labour which led to pregnancy termination. Whereas the remaining 8 women gave birth by caesarean section and 1 woman by vaginal delivery. The neonates of these 9 women were full term and live birth.

There have been reports of these reactions occurring with children and adults on both suspension and capsules and its seems unlikely that the reactions would be associated with the formulation rather than the drug. Serum sickness-like reactions or erythema multiforme occurred with the first course of cefaclor in 5 of the 7 children developing these reactions and reactions also occurred with therapies repeated within 5 days to 1 year of the initial therapy. Although there was no systematic history of family allergies taken, no child with a known allergy to penicillin was entered into the trial and, on reviewing the records of the children showing these reactions, only 1 had a previous allergy to cotrimoxazole |trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole]  \n",

Dosages used were those stated in the approved labelling.<BR />Children receiving cefaclor experienced 2513 infectious episodes and received an average of 2.44 treatment courses compared with 2358 episodes and 2.33 courses/patient for those given amoxicillin. The incidences of various hypersensitivity reactions with cefaclor and amoxicillin, respectively, were: total, 54 vs 37; serum sickness, 5 vs 0 (p &#60; 0.001); erythema multiforme, 6 vs 0 (p &#60; 0.001); urticaria, 24 vs 8 (p =0.0066); maculopapular rash, 18 vs 28; vesicular rash, 1 vs 0; and joint swelling, 0 vs 1. Other reactions occurred with approximately equal frequency in the respective groups and consisted of gastrointestinal reactions (72 vs 60), skin reactions (13 vs 5), genitourinary reactions (6 vs 3), CNS effects (7 vs 2) and others (6 vs 2).<BR />Although the overall incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was similar in the 2 groups, only those given cefaclor experienced serum sickness and erythema multiforme, while urticaria occurred more frequently in the cefaclor group. The frequency of these 3 reactions together was significantly higher in the cefaclor group, both overall (3.4% with cefaclor vs 0.79% with amoxicillin) and in the incidence per drug course (cefaclor 1.4% vs amoxicillin 0.34%). Further, the incidence of these 3 reactions was significantly higher during the second and third courses of cefaclor therapy than in the first course  \n",

A multicenter trial of 1016 patients reported an incidence rate of 0.5%, consisting of a skin rash with polyarthrits and frequently fever. In a report of 8 children receiving cefaclor 40-60 mg/kg/day for otitis media, rash and arthritis appeared after 5-19 days, and disappeared4-5 days after ceasing treatment. Six of the patients had previously received cefaclor. Although 1 patient required hospitalization, the others did not require symptomatic treatment. Another 3-year-old child developed polyarthritis and a diffuse urticarial rash after 7 days' treatment with cefaclor 125mg every 8 hours for otitis media. The symptoms disappeared while taking chlorpheniramine. The patient had previously had amoxicillin and cefaclor with no side effects. A 39-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus developed an extensive pruritic erythematosus rash and arthralgias after receiving cefaclor 250mg tid. She had a previous history of allergy to penicillin, sulfonamides and erythromycin. She did not have a recurrence of the reaction when she was later treated with chloramphenicol and cefazolin.<BR />Serum sickness generally develops within 5-19 days and resolves within a few days of ceasing cefaclor therapy Other cefalosporins and penicillins may still be taken if the reaction has been reported with cefaclor, and antihistamines and steroids appear to help resolve the symptoms  \n",

Within 2 days the fever abated and the general and respiratory condition of the child improved. However, he complained of abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea on the eighth day of treatment, and cefaclor was withdrawn 2 days later when his temperature rose to 38 degreesC. The child remained upset and anorexic, with pruritus and insomnia. He had a mild erythematous rash on his body, conjunctival jaundice, and swelling of the liver, spleen and glands. At that time, ESR was 11 mm/hr, serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 677 IU (normal 150-470 IU), gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase 43 U/L (normal 1-28 U/L) and total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, cyclomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, and antinuclear-antibody were all negative Urinalysis gave a pH of 6, positive bilirubin and a RBC of 10/HPF.<BR />Although microhematuria lasted for 50 days with 1 episode of macrohematuria, glomerular and tubular functions remained within normal limits and urinary cultures were negative. Liver enzymes returned to normal within 45 days and the child was healthy and well at follow-up.<BR />The sequence of clinical signs and symptoms suggest that the child either had a biphasic or complicated infection, or suffered a hypersensitivity reaction to cefaclor. A drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction seems to explain the course of events better. The appearance of symptoms following exposure to cefaclor and the recession once the drug was withdrawn suggest a cause-effect relationship  \n",

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption. No further recurrence of erythema was observed.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&amp;quot;We report a case of erythro-papular drug eruption caused by [fosravuconazole].&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He had experienced a drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He started systemic treatment with cefaclor…oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day.

Subsequently, he started receiving treatment with cefaclor. Four days during the treatment, his general condition deteriorated and it was observed that he had a fever with associated chills. Thereafter, he started receiving treatment with clindamycin, ibuprofen [Brufen] and ganciclovir in addition to cefaclor. After a day, he had trouble breathing, which worse when lying flat. However, despite these treatments his general condition deteriorated contineously. A chest CT scan revaled multilobar pneumonia, which was more severe on the left upper lobe. Due to his worsening multilobar pneumonia despite treatment with cefaclor, clindamycin, ibuprofen and ganciclovir (lack of efficacy) he was shifted to EICU for further management. After further investigations, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, sepsis, moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) and left ventricular dysfunction. The treatment course was focused on stabilising his condition by oxygen supplementation and through the proper course of treatment including ertapenem, azithromycin, nicardipine and prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir [oseltamivir phosphate], umifenovir [arbidol hydrochloride], heparin and esomeprazole. After the treatment, marked improvement in his general condition was observed.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n[D]espite treatment with…[cefaclor, clindamycin, ibuprofen and ganciclovir], his general condition continued to deteriorate…chest CT scan…showed multilobar pneumonia that was more severe on the left upper lobe…due to his worsening clinical state despite all the medical intervention, he was referred to our EICU&amp;quot;.</td>\n",

It was found that despite antibiotic therapy with oral cefaclor 30 mg/kg/d (administered in 3 divided doses) and bronchodilator therapy with procaterol [procaterol hydrochloride] for 7 consecutive days, his respiratory status had progressively deteriorated. On admission, a chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation.&lt;EM&gt; Streptococcus pneumoniae &lt;/EM&gt;urinary antigen was found to be positive. A working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. Therefore, he started receiving IV amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [&lt;EM&gt;dosage not stated&lt;/EM&gt;], unspecified corticosteroids, unspecified bronchodilaters and unspecified mucolytics. On the second day of hospitalisation, he developed an irregular macular rash on the neck, face and trunk and β-lactam antibiotic allergy was suspected.&lt;BR /&gt;The boy was treated with cetirizine [cetirizine hydrochloride]. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced by meropenem. In the following three days, his rash transformed into a confluent maculopapular exanthema with blisters and denudation of the epidermis in large patches that covered large areas (roughly 90%) of the body surface. He developed multiple erosive lesions on the oropharyngeal, anal and ocular mucosa. Additionally, he was dyspnoeic and febrile. He was diagnosed with TEN. He was transferred to paediatric ICU due to hypoxaemia. He underwent noninvasive ventilation and received an unspecified supportive systemic therapy, methylprednisolone, unspecified gamma globulin, unspecified ophthalmic lubricant, plasmapheresis and surgical wound care. His wound swab culture revealed &lt;EM&gt;Acinetobacter baumanii&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/EM&gt;. Meropenem was replaced by tigeycline and unspecified polymyxins. During the hospitalisation period, he had tachycardia and TEN score was 2 (mild). His skin reepithelialised progressively. Following 14 weeks of the hospitalisation, he was discharged.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&amp;quot;This might suggest that the [toxic epidermal necrolysis] developed in response to [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid], although the immune-related cytotoxic reaction could have been initiated during the initial antibiotic treatment with cefaclor.&amp;quot;</td>\n",

Four weeks prior to the presentation, he had received cefaclor and and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for three days following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, he developed nausea, cough, diarrhoea and enlargement of right parotid gland. Initial treatment included empirical therapy with levofloxacin. Two days prior to the hospitalisation, he developed chills, rigours along with diarrhoea and cough. His body temperature was 40.0°C. Maculopapular rash was noted on both the arms. During the following 2 days, the rash spread throughout the body including the face and he was admitted. On admission, his body temperature was 37.4°C, HR 120 beats/min, RR 30 breaths/min, BP 87/45mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was noted to have erythematous macules and papules on the entire body along with facial oedema. The Nikolsky sign (blistering on pressure) was negative. The WBC count was 40.4 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;/µL, with 1.5% atypical lymphocytes and 10.5% eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 6.76 mg/dL, ALT 2204 U/mL, AST 1763 U/mL, BUN 74.9 mg/dL and troponin I level was increased to 7.623 ng/mL. All the serological tests were negative. Skin biopsy and histopathology revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocyte infiltrates. An abdomen CT scan demonstrated slight enlargement of the periaortic lymph nodes. He developed profound hypotension and oliguric azotaemia shortly after admission.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with norepinephrine and was started on haemodialysis. An ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–6. Two days after the admission, reduction in the size of the left ventricular cavity due to oedematous and thickened ventricular wall was evident from echocardiography. Pericardial effusion was also noted along with a diffuse reduction in the left ventricular systolic function. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 52%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome was made. Pericardiocentesis was performed and veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA ECMO) was initiated. Based on the findings and symptoms a definitive diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. On day 3 following admission, the RegiSCAR score was 8. He started receiving treatment with prednisolone, following which cardiogenic shock and rash resolved rapidly. Two days after the initiation of prednisolone (day 5), norepinephrine and VA ECMO were stopped. On repeat echocardiography performed on day 14, marked improvement in the systolic function and myocardial oedema was noted. Haemodialysis was discontinued. One day after the administration of corticosteroids, the ALT and AST levels began decreasing and normalised after 2 months. After 5 weeks following corticosteroid administration, the skin rash resolved completely. The dose of corticosteroids was tapered gradually. He was discharged with no sequelae and after 9 weeks, corticosteroid therapy was stopped.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&amp;quot;In this case, it is possible that previous treatment with the cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug four weeks prior to hospital admission, were probable case of DRESS&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;A rare case of myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome is presented.&amp;quot;</td>\n",

       "      <td>Case 1: 30 min after eceiving oral cefaclor 250mg and other drugs for an upper respiratory tract infection a 27-year-old woman developed urticaria followed by fainting and a decrease in systolic BP to 70mm Hg. Treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, chlorpheniramine, epinephrine |adrenaline] and Ringer's lactate. After systolic BP fell further to 30mm Hg, administration of dopamine 20 mcgkg/min increased systolic BP to 94mm Hg. The patient was subsequently discharged from hospital. 10 months later, intradermal skin testing with cefaclor 0.6mcg gave a positive reaction.&lt;BR /&gt;Cases 2 and 3: A 51-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman experienced typical anaphylactic reactions after oral cefaclor. Both gave positive reactions to intradermal skin testing with 0.6mcg and 0.6mcg cefaclor, respectively.&lt;BR /&gt;Cases 4 and 5: Two men aged 73 and 57 years received cefaclor 250mg and bromhexine (1 tablet), and cefaclor 250mg, respectively. 40 min after drug administration systolic BP fell to 60mm Hg (Case 4); urticaria, dyspnea, cyanosis and stupor were noted after drug intake (Case 5). A positive skin reaction was noted with 0.6mcg intradermal cefaclor in Case 5.&lt;BR /&gt;In Japan, of 35,146 patients treated with cefaclor, 5 cases of anaphylaxis have been reported vs 0 of 70,146 cefalexin and 57,970 amoxicillin recipients (p &amp;#60; 0.01). On this basis it has been suggested that cefaclor should not be recommended as first-line therapy and intradermal skin testing be carried out before drug administration</td>\n",

The patient had also had a presumed urinary tract infection 10 days earlier and was prescribed cefaclor 500mg three times daily changed 2 days later (because of nausea) to IM gentamicin 80mcg daily for 5 days, followed by chloramphenicol 500mcg twice daily for 3 days.&lt;BR /&gt;Examination on admission showed the liver was enlarged, there was diffuse abdominal and kidney pain but no dysuria. A percutaneous renal biopsy 3 days after admission demonstrated acute interstitial nephritis. A lymphocyte transformation test revealed an elevated lymphocyte stimulation index for cefaclor.

       "      <td>A child, just under 4 years old, was admitted with fever associated with acute left pleuropneumonia and received cefaclor 40 mg/kg tid. Within 2 days the fever abated and the general and respiratory condition of the child improved. However, he complained of abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea on the eighth day of treatment, and cefaclor was withdrawn 2 days later when his temperature rose to 38 degreesC. The child remained upset and anorexic, with pruritus and insomnia. He had a mild erythematous rash on his body, conjunctival jaundice, and swelling of the liver, spleen and glands. At that time, ESR was 11 mm/hr, serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 677 IU (normal 150-470 IU), gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase 43 U/L (normal 1-28 U/L) and total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, cyclomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, and antinuclear-antibody were all negative Urinalysis gave a pH of 6, positive bilirubin and a RBC of 10/HPF.&lt;BR /&gt;Although microhematuria lasted for 50 days with 1 episode of macrohematuria, glomerular and tubular functions remained within normal limits and urinary cultures were negative. Liver enzymes returned to normal within 45 days and the child was healthy and well at follow-up.&lt;BR /&gt;The sequence of clinical signs and symptoms suggest that the child either had a biphasic or complicated infection, or suffered a hypersensitivity reaction to cefaclor. A drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction seems to explain the course of events better. The appearance of symptoms following exposure to cefaclor and the recession once the drug was withdrawn suggest a cause-effect relationship</td>\n",

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.<BR />The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption.

Subsequently, he started receiving treatment with cefaclor. Four days during the treatment, his general condition deteriorated and it was observed that he had a fever with associated chills. Thereafter, he started receiving treatment with clindamycin, ibuprofen [Brufen] and ganciclovir in addition to cefaclor. After a day, he had trouble breathing, which worse when lying flat. However, despite these treatments his general condition deteriorated contineously. A chest CT scan revaled multilobar pneumonia, which was more severe on the left upper lobe. Due to his worsening multilobar pneumonia despite treatment with cefaclor, clindamycin, ibuprofen and ganciclovir (lack of efficacy) he was shifted to EICU for further management. After further investigations, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, sepsis, moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) and left ventricular dysfunction. The treatment course was focused on stabilising his condition by oxygen supplementation and through the proper course of treatment including ertapenem, azithromycin, nicardipine and prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir [oseltamivir phosphate], umifenovir [arbidol hydrochloride], heparin and esomeprazole.

It was found that despite antibiotic therapy with oral cefaclor 30 mg/kg/d (administered in 3 divided doses) and bronchodilator therapy with procaterol [procaterol hydrochloride] for 7 consecutive days, his respiratory status had progressively deteriorated. On admission, a chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation.<EM> Streptococcus pneumoniae </EM>urinary antigen was found to be positive. A working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. Therefore, he started receiving IV amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [<EM>dosage not stated</EM>], unspecified corticosteroids, unspecified bronchodilaters and unspecified mucolytics. On the second day of hospitalisation, he developed an irregular macular rash on the neck, face and trunk and β-lactam antibiotic allergy was suspected.<BR />The boy was treated with cetirizine [cetirizine hydrochloride]. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced by meropenem. In the following three days, his rash transformed into a confluent maculopapular exanthema with blisters and denudation of the epidermis in large patches that covered large areas (roughly 90%) of the body surface. He developed multiple erosive lesions on the oropharyngeal, anal and ocular mucosa. Additionally, he was dyspnoeic and febrile. He was diagnosed with TEN. He was transferred to paediatric ICU due to hypoxaemia. He underwent noninvasive ventilation and received an unspecified supportive systemic therapy, methylprednisolone, unspecified gamma globulin, unspecified ophthalmic lubricant, plasmapheresis and surgical wound care. His wound swab culture revealed <EM>Acinetobacter baumanii</EM> and <EM>Klebsiella pneumoniae</EM>. Meropenem was replaced by tigeycline and unspecified polymyxins. During the hospitalisation period, he had tachycardia and TEN score was 2 (mild). His skin reepithelialised progressively. Following 14 weeks of the hospitalisation, he was discharged.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;This might suggest that the [toxic epidermal necrolysis] developed in response to [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid], although the immune-related cytotoxic reaction could have been initiated during the initial antibiotic treatment with cefaclor.&quot;  \n",

The female patient, who had acute uncomplicated cystitis, started receiving oral cefaclor 750mg daily for 5−7 days. On the day of cefaclor prescription, she developed nausea. Therefore, cefaclor was discontinued, and the therapy was transitioned to unspecified alternate antibiotic. On the next day of cefaclor discontinuation, nausea disappeared completely.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;With respect to the adverse events related to [cefaclor], as previous studies described low incidence of side effects, only one patient was excluded in this study due to nausea, which disappeared the next day after [cefaclor] discontinuation.&quot;  \n",
       "14  A 33-year-old man developed DRESS syndrome, myocarditis, cardiogenic shock, oliguric azotaemia and liver dysfunction following treatment with cefaclor and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [<EM>dosages and routes not stated; not all times to reaction onsets stated</EM>].<BR />The man presented to hospital with diarrhoea, fever and diffuse maculopapular rash for 2 days. Four weeks prior to the presentation, he had received cefaclor and and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for three days following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, he developed nausea, cough, diarrhoea and enlargement of right parotid gland. Initial treatment included empirical therapy with levofloxacin. Two days prior to the hospitalisation, he developed chills, rigours along with diarrhoea and cough. His body temperature was 40.0°C. Maculopapular rash was noted on both the arms. During the following 2 days, the rash spread throughout the body including the face and he was admitted. On admission, his body temperature was 37.4°C, HR 120 beats/min, RR 30 breaths/min, BP 87/45mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was noted to have erythematous macules and papules on the entire body along with facial oedema. The Nikolsky sign (blistering on pressure) was negative. The WBC count was 40.4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP>/µL, with 1.5% atypical lymphocytes and 10.5% eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 6.76 mg/dL, ALT 2204 U/mL, AST 1763 U/mL, BUN 74.9 mg/dL and troponin I level was increased to 7.623 ng/mL. All the serological tests were negative. Skin biopsy and histopathology revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocyte infiltrates. An abdomen CT scan demonstrated slight enlargement of the periaortic lymph nodes. He developed profound hypotension and oliguric azotaemia shortly after admission.<BR />The man received treatment with norepinephrine and was started on haemodialysis. An ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–6. Two days after the admission, reduction in the size of the left ventricular cavity due to oedematous and thickened ventricular wall was evident from echocardiography. Pericardial effusion was also noted along with a diffuse reduction in the left ventricular systolic function. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 52%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome was made. Pericardiocentesis was performed and veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA ECMO) was initiated. Based on the findings and symptoms a definitive diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. On day 3 following admission, the RegiSCAR score was 8. He started receiving treatment with prednisolone, following which cardiogenic shock and rash resolved rapidly. Two days after the initiation of prednisolone (day 5), norepinephrine and VA ECMO were stopped. On repeat echocardiography performed on day 14, marked improvement in the systolic function and myocardial oedema was noted. Haemodialysis was discontinued. One day after the administration of corticosteroids, the ALT and AST levels began decreasing and normalised after 2 months. After 5 weeks following corticosteroid administration, the skin rash resolved completely. The dose of corticosteroids was tapered gradually. He was discharged with no sequelae and after 9 weeks, corticosteroid therapy was stopped.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;In this case, it is possible that previous treatment with the cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug four weeks prior to hospital admission, were probable case of DRESS&quot;. &quot;A rare case of myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome is presented.&quot;  \n",

A series of laboratory examinations were done that were found to be normal except an INR of 3.9 and elevated serum potassium.<BR />The woman underwent anterior chamber paracentesis that lowered her intraocular pressure and statim dilatation was carried out with guttae tropicamide. The clot retracted clearing the visual axis and leading to improvement in right eye visual acuity. The woman was started on atropine, prednisolone, brinzolamide, timolol, latanoprost and brimonidine. She also received vitamin K to normalise her INR and resonium decreased her serum potassium. The hyphaema resolved completely after 48 hours and her right visual acuity had improved to 6/12\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;Coagulation studies revealed a supratherapeutic INR of 3.9 and electrolyte analysis revealed elevated serum potassium of 5.9 mEq/L, both of which were deemed iatrogenic secondary to her recent oral antibiotic use..&quot;In conclusion, this is a novel case of an elderly lady with IVTs and subsequent spontaneous hyphaema which in our opinion was likely related to over-anticoagulation and possibly aggravated by sleeping on the ipsilateral side.&quot;  \n",

His symptoms had started after he took oral cefaclor 500mg for pharyngitis. He had an erythematous rash over his entire body and dyspnoea with tremor.<BR />The man received IV methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, ranitidine and epinephrine [adrenaline]. An ECG showed Q waves at the inferior leads, his serum IgE level was 275 IU/mL (normal 5−165) and his C-reactive protein level was 1.1 mg/dL (&#60;0.8). On day 3 of hospitalisation, he complained of chest pain, and an ECG showed negative T waves in the inferior leads. A troponin-I test was positive at 0.77 ng/mL (normal 0.4) and he was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The next day, coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of his right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was unsuccessful. He was diagnosed with late stent thrombosis and an acute coronary syndrome due to Kounis syndrome. An echocardiogram showed akinesia of the middle and apex parts of the inferior wall, and an ejection fraction of 50%. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth day after myocardial infarction.  \n",

She was then lost to follow-up but had continued treatment with prednisone. One year later she presented with diffuse vesiculobullous lesions 20 days after starting cefaclor [<EM>dosage and route not stated</EM>]. On examination she appeared exhausted, wasted and generally ill, with bullae, vesicles and urticarial plaques on her neck, arms, abdomen, back and groin as well as warm, tender, swollen wrist, elbow and knee joints. Laboratory investigations revealed the following values: WBC count 2700/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, platelet count 940 000/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, haemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, ESR 120 mm/h, CRP 17.7 mg/dL and normal complement C3 and C4 levels. Testing also revealed autoimmune thyroiditis with elevated TSH and human antithyroglobulin levels and low free thyroxine.<BR />IgA bullous dermatosis was diagnosed following a skin biopsy and the girl was treated with pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, as well as dapsone and colchicine. Methotrexate was added 1 month postadmission for resistant disease and her lesions started to resolve. She was then referred 9 months postadmission with widespread blistering involving multiple areas of her body and oral ulcers. Investigations revealed normal C4 but low C3 levels and positive results for antihistone and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies; testing for anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant was negative. Thrombocytosis and haemolytic anaemia were also detected. Treatment with oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone was started and her lesions resolved in 4 weeks.

During a hospital stay for suspected rheumatoid arthritis, he had received three IM injections of gentamicin, 12 hours apart, for symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection one day before lesion onset. He had initially been treated with dexamethasone at a different ward, and was then diagnosed with TEN and transferred. Further investigations revealed that he also had an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month before development of the lesions, which had been treated with doxycycline, cefaclor, cefotaxime and local fusafungine. Additionally, he had been prescribed sulfasalazine for suspected ulcerative colitis a few weeks before TEN onset. He also had a history of taking body-building supplements for a few months 10 years earlier. On admission, he had erythematous lesions on his entire body, with extensive epidermal detachment and positive Nikolsky's sign. Erythematous oedematous, vesicular and bullous lesions were evident on his extremities and abdomen, and extensive erosive mucosal lesions developed. He became unable to open his eyes, and experienced severe pain. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: ESR of 36 mm/h, CRP 134 mg/L, AST 56 U/L and ALT 175 U/L.<BR />The man received methylprednisolone and was transferred to an ICU. Further treatment included ciclosporin, plasmapheresis with albumin transfusions, and high-dose analgesics. At therapy initiation, epidermal detachment progressed to include 100% of his skin surface area. He developed progressive respiratory insufficiency and septicaemia, and required intubation and ventilation on day 5. Tracheotomy was performed on day 9. He developed blood, skin, and respiratory and urinary tract infections, and started receiving targeted antibiotic therapy; he also received febrifugal and anticoagulant medications, gastric protection, potassium supplements, and enteral and parenteral nutrition. Ophthalmological examination revealed adhesions of the eyelids to his conjunctiva, trichosis, scarring of his eyelid margin and blepharospasm; treatment comprised neomycin ointment, prednisolone and ofloxacin eye drops and artificial tears. His skin lesions began to improve after 7 days of therapy, and further epidermal detachment regressed. Epidermisation was observed over the following days. He was in good condition on discharge after 38 days, with residual soft erythema on his entire body. His skin condition continued to improve during follow-up, but ophthalmological follow-up was indicative of photophobia and dry eye syndrome.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\nThe first skin lesions appeared in this patient after intramuscular injections of gentamicin… In the period preceding the onset of symptoms, the patient was receiving numerous other drugs that could have contributed to the development of his condition. … The causative factor was difficult to pinpoint.\\n\\nEditorial Comment\\nA search of AdisBase, Medline, Embase and the WHO ADR database did not reveal any previous case reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with fusafungine.  \n",

She had previously taken cefaclor on several occasions.<BR />The woman developed generalised fatigue, declining energy levels and malaise 1 week after taking a 7-day course of cefaclor 250mg 3 times daily. She was also taking conjugated estrogen and ibuprofen. Approximately 1 month later, she developed nausea, night sweats and chills, fleeting stabbing right flank pain and intermittent and vague abdominal and chest discomfort. She also developed gross haematuria that lasted for 7 days before resolving spontaneously.<BR />The woman was evaluated 1 month later and blood tests, urine analysis and the findings of a kidney biopsy were consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. In addition, an abdominal CT scan revealed multiple bilateral solid renal masses. She was treated with a 12-week course of tapering dose prednisone.<BR />At follow-up 1 month after starting treatment with prednisone, the woman's energy level and appetite had started to improve. One month after finishing her course of prednisone, a CT scan revealed normal kidneys and complete resolution of the renal masses and parenchymal displacement. She remained totally asymptomatic and in good health 1 year later.  \n",

Cefaclor was discontinued within 24 hours of admission. The rash improved, but she became lethargic, had a fever (39.4°C) and showed signs of low cardiac output.<BR />The girl's BP was 68/30mm Hg, her pulse rate was 120 beats/min and her respiratory rate was 55 breaths/min. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed an S<SUB>3</SUB> gallop rhythm, and rhonchi at both lung bases. She also had mild metabolic acidosis and a creatinine level of 171 mmol/L. A chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema. An ECG showed inverted T waves and diffused low voltages in leads V<SUB>4</SUB> to V<SUB>6</SUB>. An echocardiogram showed depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%, a shortening fraction of 17% and a shortening velocity of 0.76 circ/sec.<BR />Viral myocarditis was suspected and the girl was intubated and treated with dopamine, adrenaline [epinephrine], nitroprusside, IV methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins. Cardiac catheterisation was performed and revealed a right arterial pressure of 12mm Hg, a main pulmonary artery pressure of 50/28mm Hg and a mean wedge pressure of 32mm Hg. An endomyocardial biopsy showed a predominantly eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate and some focal necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Because histological findings were atypical for viral myocarditis, hypersensitivity myocarditis to cefaclor was suspected.<BR />The girl's clinical condition improved and inotropic support was stopped over the next 5 days.

The appearance of a dark red erythema with numerous pustular eruptions on the trunk, arms and neck area was treated unsuccessfully with oral prednisolone for 7 days. Microscopic examination revealed spongiform pustules of Kogoj.<BR />Withdrawal of all drugs led to a gradual subsidence of eruptions over 3 weeks. Subsequent test dose of both oral cefaclor and acetazolamide resulted in the development of erythematous macules and pustules on the woman's trunk, neck and nape.<BR />'Of particular interest in our patient is the fact that the 2 drugs induced the same exanthema. Because there is no structural resemblance between cefaclor and acetazolamide, it is unlikely that these drugs have a cross-reactivity with each other ...

Treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, chlorpheniramine, epinephrine |adrenaline] and Ringer's lactate. After systolic BP fell further to 30mm Hg, administration of dopamine 20 mcgkg/min increased systolic BP to 94mm Hg. The patient was subsequently discharged from hospital. 10 months later, intradermal skin testing with cefaclor 0.6mcg gave a positive reaction.<BR />Cases 2 and 3: A 51-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman experienced typical anaphylactic reactions after oral cefaclor. Both gave positive reactions to intradermal skin testing with 0.6mcg and 0.6mcg cefaclor, respectively.<BR />Cases 4 and 5: Two men aged 73 and 57 years received cefaclor 250mg and bromhexine (1 tablet), and cefaclor 250mg, respectively. 40 min after drug administration systolic BP fell to 60mm Hg (Case 4); urticaria, dyspnea, cyanosis and stupor were noted after drug intake (Case 5). A positive skin reaction was noted with 0.6mcg intradermal cefaclor in Case 5.<BR />In Japan, of 35,146 patients treated with cefaclor, 5 cases of anaphylaxis have been reported vs 0 of 70,146 cefalexin and 57,970 amoxicillin recipients (p &#60; 0.01). On this basis it has been suggested that cefaclor should not be recommended as first-line therapy and intradermal skin testing be carried out before drug administration  \n",

The patient had also had a presumed urinary tract infection 10 days earlier and was prescribed cefaclor 500mg three times daily changed 2 days later (because of nausea) to IM gentamicin 80mcg daily for 5 days, followed by chloramphenicol 500mcg twice daily for 3 days.<BR />Examination on admission showed the liver was enlarged, there was diffuse abdominal and kidney pain but no dysuria. A percutaneous renal biopsy 3 days after admission demonstrated acute interstitial nephritis. A lymphocyte transformation test revealed an elevated lymphocyte stimulation index for cefaclor. Renal function was normal 4 weeks after discontinuing cefaclor treatment  \n",

Within 2 days the fever abated and the general and respiratory condition of the child improved. However, he complained of abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea on the eighth day of treatment, and cefaclor was withdrawn 2 days later when his temperature rose to 38 degreesC. The child remained upset and anorexic, with pruritus and insomnia. He had a mild erythematous rash on his body, conjunctival jaundice, and swelling of the liver, spleen and glands. At that time, ESR was 11 mm/hr, serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 677 IU (normal 150-470 IU), gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase 43 U/L (normal 1-28 U/L) and total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, cyclomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, and antinuclear-antibody were all negative Urinalysis gave a pH of 6, positive bilirubin and a RBC of 10/HPF.<BR />Although microhematuria lasted for 50 days with 1 episode of macrohematuria, glomerular and tubular functions remained within normal limits and urinary cultures were negative. Liver enzymes returned to normal within 45 days and the child was healthy and well at follow-up.<BR />The sequence of clinical signs and symptoms suggest that the child either had a biphasic or complicated infection, or suffered a hypersensitivity reaction to cefaclor. A drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction seems to explain the course of events better. The appearance of symptoms following exposure to cefaclor and the recession once the drug was withdrawn suggest a cause-effect relationship  "

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption.

Four weeks prior to the presentation, he had received cefaclor and and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for three days following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, he developed nausea, cough, diarrhoea and enlargement of right parotid gland. Initial treatment included empirical therapy with levofloxacin. Two days prior to the hospitalisation, he developed chills, rigours along with diarrhoea and cough. His body temperature was 40.0°C. Maculopapular rash was noted on both the arms. During the following 2 days, the rash spread throughout the body including the face and he was admitted. On admission, his body temperature was 37.4°C, HR 120 beats/min, RR 30 breaths/min, BP 87/45mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was noted to have erythematous macules and papules on the entire body along with facial oedema. The Nikolsky sign (blistering on pressure) was negative. The WBC count was 40.4 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;/µL, with 1.5% atypical lymphocytes and 10.5% eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 6.76 mg/dL, ALT 2204 U/mL, AST 1763 U/mL, BUN 74.9 mg/dL and troponin I level was increased to 7.623 ng/mL. All the serological tests were negative. Skin biopsy and histopathology revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocyte infiltrates. An abdomen CT scan demonstrated slight enlargement of the periaortic lymph nodes. He developed profound hypotension and oliguric azotaemia shortly after admission.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with norepinephrine and was started on haemodialysis. An ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–6. Two days after the admission, reduction in the size of the left ventricular cavity due to oedematous and thickened ventricular wall was evident from echocardiography. Pericardial effusion was also noted along with a diffuse reduction in the left ventricular systolic function. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 52%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome was made. Pericardiocentesis was performed and veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA ECMO) was initiated. Based on the findings and symptoms a definitive diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. On day 3 following admission, the RegiSCAR score was 8. He started receiving treatment with prednisolone, following which cardiogenic shock and rash resolved rapidly. Two days after the initiation of prednisolone (day 5), norepinephrine and VA ECMO were stopped. On repeat echocardiography performed on day 14, marked improvement in the systolic function and myocardial oedema was noted. Haemodialysis was discontinued. One day after the administration of corticosteroids, the ALT and AST levels began decreasing and normalised after 2 months. After 5 weeks following corticosteroid administration, the skin rash resolved completely. The dose of corticosteroids was tapered gradually.

During a hospital stay for suspected rheumatoid arthritis, he had received three IM injections of gentamicin, 12 hours apart, for symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection one day before lesion onset. He had initially been treated with dexamethasone at a different ward, and was then diagnosed with TEN and transferred. Further investigations revealed that he also had an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month before development of the lesions, which had been treated with doxycycline, cefaclor, cefotaxime and local fusafungine. Additionally, he had been prescribed sulfasalazine for suspected ulcerative colitis a few weeks before TEN onset. He also had a history of taking body-building supplements for a few months 10 years earlier. On admission, he had erythematous lesions on his entire body, with extensive epidermal detachment and positive Nikolsky's sign. Erythematous oedematous, vesicular and bullous lesions were evident on his extremities and abdomen, and extensive erosive mucosal lesions developed.

Laboratory investigations revealed the following: ESR of 36 mm/h, CRP 134 mg/L, AST 56 U/L and ALT 175 U/L.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received methylprednisolone and was transferred to an ICU. Further treatment included ciclosporin, plasmapheresis with albumin transfusions, and high-dose analgesics.

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.<BR />The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption. No further recurrence of erythema was observed.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;We report a case of erythro-papular drug eruption caused by [fosravuconazole].&quot; &quot;He had experienced a drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam.&quot; &quot;He started systemic treatment with cefaclor…oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day.

Subsequently, he started receiving treatment with cefaclor. Four days during the treatment, his general condition deteriorated and it was observed that he had a fever with associated chills. Thereafter, he started receiving treatment with clindamycin, ibuprofen [Brufen] and ganciclovir in addition to cefaclor. After a day, he had trouble breathing, which worse when lying flat. However, despite these treatments his general condition deteriorated contineously. A chest CT scan revaled multilobar pneumonia, which was more severe on the left upper lobe. Due to his worsening multilobar pneumonia despite treatment with cefaclor, clindamycin, ibuprofen and ganciclovir (lack of efficacy) he was shifted to EICU for further management. After further investigations, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, sepsis, moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) and left ventricular dysfunction.

It was found that despite antibiotic therapy with oral cefaclor 30 mg/kg/d (administered in 3 divided doses) and bronchodilator therapy with procaterol [procaterol hydrochloride] for 7 consecutive days, his respiratory status had progressively deteriorated. On admission, a chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation.<EM> Streptococcus pneumoniae </EM>urinary antigen was found to be positive. A working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. Therefore, he started receiving IV amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [<EM>dosage not stated</EM>], unspecified corticosteroids, unspecified bronchodilaters and unspecified mucolytics. On the second day of hospitalisation, he developed an irregular macular rash on the neck, face and trunk and β-lactam antibiotic allergy was suspected.<BR />The boy was treated with cetirizine [cetirizine hydrochloride]. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced by meropenem. In the following three days, his rash transformed into a confluent maculopapular exanthema with blisters and denudation of the epidermis in large patches that covered large areas (roughly 90%) of the body surface. He developed multiple erosive lesions on the oropharyngeal, anal and ocular mucosa. Additionally, he was dyspnoeic and febrile. He was diagnosed with TEN. He was transferred to paediatric ICU due to hypoxaemia. He underwent noninvasive ventilation and received an unspecified supportive systemic therapy, methylprednisolone, unspecified gamma globulin, unspecified ophthalmic lubricant, plasmapheresis and surgical wound care. His wound swab culture revealed <EM>Acinetobacter baumanii</EM> and <EM>Klebsiella pneumoniae</EM>. Meropenem was replaced by tigeycline and unspecified polymyxins. During the hospitalisation period, he had tachycardia and TEN score was 2 (mild). His skin reepithelialised progressively. Following 14 weeks of the hospitalisation, he was discharged.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;This might suggest that the [toxic epidermal necrolysis] developed in response to [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid], although the immune-related cytotoxic reaction could have been initiated during the initial antibiotic treatment with cefaclor.&quot;   \n",

The female patient, who had acute uncomplicated cystitis, started receiving oral cefaclor 750mg daily for 5−7 days. On the day of cefaclor prescription, she developed nausea. Therefore, cefaclor was discontinued, and the therapy was transitioned to unspecified alternate antibiotic. On the next day of cefaclor discontinuation, nausea disappeared completely.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;With respect to the adverse events related to [cefaclor], as previous studies described low incidence of side effects, only one patient was excluded in this study due to nausea, which disappeared the next day after [cefaclor] discontinuation.&quot;   \n",
       "14  A 33-year-old man developed DRESS syndrome, myocarditis, cardiogenic shock, oliguric azotaemia and liver dysfunction following treatment with cefaclor and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [<EM>dosages and routes not stated; not all times to reaction onsets stated</EM>].<BR />The man presented to hospital with diarrhoea, fever and diffuse maculopapular rash for 2 days. Four weeks prior to the presentation, he had received cefaclor and and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for three days following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, he developed nausea, cough, diarrhoea and enlargement of right parotid gland. Initial treatment included empirical therapy with levofloxacin. Two days prior to the hospitalisation, he developed chills, rigours along with diarrhoea and cough. His body temperature was 40.0°C. Maculopapular rash was noted on both the arms. During the following 2 days, the rash spread throughout the body including the face and he was admitted. On admission, his body temperature was 37.4°C, HR 120 beats/min, RR 30 breaths/min, BP 87/45mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was noted to have erythematous macules and papules on the entire body along with facial oedema. The Nikolsky sign (blistering on pressure) was negative. The WBC count was 40.4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP>/µL, with 1.5% atypical lymphocytes and 10.5% eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 6.76 mg/dL, ALT 2204 U/mL, AST 1763 U/mL, BUN 74.9 mg/dL and troponin I level was increased to 7.623 ng/mL. All the serological tests were negative. Skin biopsy and histopathology revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocyte infiltrates. An abdomen CT scan demonstrated slight enlargement of the periaortic lymph nodes. He developed profound hypotension and oliguric azotaemia shortly after admission.<BR />The man received treatment with norepinephrine and was started on haemodialysis. An ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–6. Two days after the admission, reduction in the size of the left ventricular cavity due to oedematous and thickened ventricular wall was evident from echocardiography. Pericardial effusion was also noted along with a diffuse reduction in the left ventricular systolic function. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 52%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome was made. Pericardiocentesis was performed and veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA ECMO) was initiated. Based on the findings and symptoms a definitive diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. On day 3 following admission, the RegiSCAR score was 8. He started receiving treatment with prednisolone, following which cardiogenic shock and rash resolved rapidly. Two days after the initiation of prednisolone (day 5), norepinephrine and VA ECMO were stopped. On repeat echocardiography performed on day 14, marked improvement in the systolic function and myocardial oedema was noted. Haemodialysis was discontinued. One day after the administration of corticosteroids, the ALT and AST levels began decreasing and normalised after 2 months. After 5 weeks following corticosteroid administration, the skin rash resolved completely. The dose of corticosteroids was tapered gradually.

She also received vitamin K to normalise her INR and resonium decreased her serum potassium. The hyphaema resolved completely after 48 hours and her right visual acuity had improved to 6/12\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;Coagulation studies revealed a supratherapeutic INR of 3.9 and electrolyte analysis revealed elevated serum potassium of 5.9 mEq/L, both of which were deemed iatrogenic secondary to her recent oral antibiotic use..&quot;In conclusion, this is a novel case of an elderly lady with IVTs and subsequent spontaneous hyphaema which in our opinion was likely related to over-anticoagulation and possibly aggravated by sleeping on the ipsilateral side.&quot;   \n",

His symptoms had started after he took oral cefaclor 500mg for pharyngitis. He had an erythematous rash over his entire body and dyspnoea with tremor.<BR />The man received IV methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, ranitidine and epinephrine [adrenaline]. An ECG showed Q waves at the inferior leads, his serum IgE level was 275 IU/mL (normal 5−165) and his C-reactive protein level was 1.1 mg/dL (&#60;0.8). On day 3 of hospitalisation, he complained of chest pain, and an ECG showed negative T waves in the inferior leads. A troponin-I test was positive at 0.77 ng/mL (normal 0.4) and he was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The next day, coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of his right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was unsuccessful. He was diagnosed with late stent thrombosis and an acute coronary syndrome due to Kounis syndrome. An echocardiogram showed akinesia of the middle and apex parts of the inferior wall, and an ejection fraction of 50%. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth day after myocardial infarction.   \n",

She was then lost to follow-up but had continued treatment with prednisone. One year later she presented with diffuse vesiculobullous lesions 20 days after starting cefaclor [<EM>dosage and route not stated</EM>]. On examination she appeared exhausted, wasted and generally ill, with bullae, vesicles and urticarial plaques on her neck, arms, abdomen, back and groin as well as warm, tender, swollen wrist, elbow and knee joints. Laboratory investigations revealed the following values: WBC count 2700/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, platelet count 940 000/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, haemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, ESR 120 mm/h, CRP 17.7 mg/dL and normal complement C3 and C4 levels. Testing also revealed autoimmune thyroiditis with elevated TSH and human antithyroglobulin levels and low free thyroxine.<BR />IgA bullous dermatosis was diagnosed following a skin biopsy and the girl was treated with pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, as well as dapsone and colchicine. Methotrexate was added 1 month postadmission for resistant disease and her lesions started to resolve. She was then referred 9 months postadmission with widespread blistering involving multiple areas of her body and oral ulcers. Investigations revealed normal C4 but low C3 levels and positive results for antihistone and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies; testing for anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant was negative.

During a hospital stay for suspected rheumatoid arthritis, he had received three IM injections of gentamicin, 12 hours apart, for symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection one day before lesion onset. He had initially been treated with dexamethasone at a different ward, and was then diagnosed with TEN and transferred. Further investigations revealed that he also had an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month before development of the lesions, which had been treated with doxycycline, cefaclor, cefotaxime and local fusafungine. Additionally, he had been prescribed sulfasalazine for suspected ulcerative colitis a few weeks before TEN onset. He also had a history of taking body-building supplements for a few months 10 years earlier. On admission, he had erythematous lesions on his entire body, with extensive epidermal detachment and positive Nikolsky's sign. Erythematous oedematous, vesicular and bullous lesions were evident on his extremities and abdomen, and extensive erosive mucosal lesions developed. He became unable to open his eyes, and experienced severe pain. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: ESR of 36 mm/h, CRP 134 mg/L, AST 56 U/L and ALT 175 U/L.<BR />The man received methylprednisolone and was transferred to an ICU. Further treatment included ciclosporin, plasmapheresis with albumin transfusions, and high-dose analgesics. At therapy initiation, epidermal detachment progressed to include 100% of his skin surface area. He developed progressive respiratory insufficiency and septicaemia, and required intubation and ventilation on day 5. Tracheotomy was performed on day 9. He developed blood, skin, and respiratory and urinary tract infections, and started receiving targeted antibiotic therapy; he also received febrifugal and anticoagulant medications, gastric protection, potassium supplements, and enteral and parenteral nutrition. Ophthalmological examination revealed adhesions of the eyelids to his conjunctiva, trichosis, scarring of his eyelid margin and blepharospasm; treatment comprised neomycin ointment, prednisolone and ofloxacin eye drops and artificial tears. His skin lesions began to improve after 7 days of therapy, and further epidermal detachment regressed. Epidermisation was observed over the following days. He was in good condition on discharge after 38 days, with residual soft erythema on his entire body. His skin condition continued to improve during follow-up, but ophthalmological follow-up was indicative of photophobia and dry eye syndrome.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\nThe first skin lesions appeared in this patient after intramuscular injections of gentamicin… In the period preceding the onset of symptoms, the patient was receiving numerous other drugs that could have contributed to the development of his condition. … The causative factor was difficult to pinpoint.\\n\\nEditorial Comment\\nA search of AdisBase, Medline, Embase and the WHO ADR database did not reveal any previous case reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with fusafungine.   \n",

She had previously taken cefaclor on several occasions.<BR />The woman developed generalised fatigue, declining energy levels and malaise 1 week after taking a 7-day course of cefaclor 250mg 3 times daily. She was also taking conjugated estrogen and ibuprofen. Approximately 1 month later, she developed nausea, night sweats and chills, fleeting stabbing right flank pain and intermittent and vague abdominal and chest discomfort. She also developed gross haematuria that lasted for 7 days before resolving spontaneously.<BR />The woman was evaluated 1 month later and blood tests, urine analysis and the findings of a kidney biopsy were consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. In addition, an abdominal CT scan revealed multiple bilateral solid renal masses. She was treated with a 12-week course of tapering dose prednisone.<BR />At follow-up 1 month after starting treatment with prednisone, the woman's energy level and appetite had started to improve. One month after finishing her course of prednisone, a CT scan revealed normal kidneys and complete resolution of the renal masses and parenchymal displacement. She remained totally asymptomatic and in good health 1 year later.   \n",

Cefaclor was discontinued within 24 hours of admission. The rash improved, but she became lethargic, had a fever (39.4°C) and showed signs of low cardiac output.<BR />The girl's BP was 68/30mm Hg, her pulse rate was 120 beats/min and her respiratory rate was 55 breaths/min. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed an S<SUB>3</SUB> gallop rhythm, and rhonchi at both lung bases. She also had mild metabolic acidosis and a creatinine level of 171 mmol/L. A chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema. An ECG showed inverted T waves and diffused low voltages in leads V<SUB>4</SUB> to V<SUB>6</SUB>. An echocardiogram showed depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%, a shortening fraction of 17% and a shortening velocity of 0.76 circ/sec.<BR />Viral myocarditis was suspected and the girl was intubated and treated with dopamine, adrenaline [epinephrine], nitroprusside, IV methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins. Cardiac catheterisation was performed and revealed a right arterial pressure of 12mm Hg, a main pulmonary artery pressure of 50/28mm Hg and a mean wedge pressure of 32mm Hg. An endomyocardial biopsy showed a predominantly eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate and some focal necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Because histological findings were atypical for viral myocarditis, hypersensitivity myocarditis to cefaclor was suspected.<BR />The girl's clinical condition improved and inotropic support was stopped over the next 5 days.

The appearance of a dark red erythema with numerous pustular eruptions on the trunk, arms and neck area was treated unsuccessfully with oral prednisolone for 7 days. Microscopic examination revealed spongiform pustules of Kogoj.<BR />Withdrawal of all drugs led to a gradual subsidence of eruptions over 3 weeks. Subsequent test dose of both oral cefaclor and acetazolamide resulted in the development of erythematous macules and pustules on the woman's trunk, neck and nape.<BR />'Of particular interest in our patient is the fact that the 2 drugs induced the same exanthema. Because there is no structural resemblance between cefaclor and acetazolamide, it is unlikely that these drugs have a cross-reactivity with each other ...

Treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, chlorpheniramine, epinephrine |adrenaline] and Ringer's lactate. After systolic BP fell further to 30mm Hg, administration of dopamine 20 mcgkg/min increased systolic BP to 94mm Hg. The patient was subsequently discharged from hospital. 10 months later, intradermal skin testing with cefaclor 0.6mcg gave a positive reaction.<BR />Cases 2 and 3: A 51-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman experienced typical anaphylactic reactions after oral cefaclor. Both gave positive reactions to intradermal skin testing with 0.6mcg and 0.6mcg cefaclor, respectively.<BR />Cases 4 and 5: Two men aged 73 and 57 years received cefaclor 250mg and bromhexine (1 tablet), and cefaclor 250mg, respectively. 40 min after drug administration systolic BP fell to 60mm Hg (Case 4); urticaria, dyspnea, cyanosis and stupor were noted after drug intake (Case 5). A positive skin reaction was noted with 0.6mcg intradermal cefaclor in Case 5.<BR />In Japan, of 35,146 patients treated with cefaclor, 5 cases of anaphylaxis have been reported vs 0 of 70,146 cefalexin and 57,970 amoxicillin recipients (p &#60; 0.01). On this basis it has been suggested that cefaclor should not be recommended as first-line therapy and intradermal skin testing be carried out before drug administration   \n",

The patient had also had a presumed urinary tract infection 10 days earlier and was prescribed cefaclor 500mg three times daily changed 2 days later (because of nausea) to IM gentamicin 80mcg daily for 5 days, followed by chloramphenicol 500mcg twice daily for 3 days.<BR />Examination on admission showed the liver was enlarged, there was diffuse abdominal and kidney pain but no dysuria. A percutaneous renal biopsy 3 days after admission demonstrated acute interstitial nephritis. A lymphocyte transformation test revealed an elevated lymphocyte stimulation index for cefaclor. Renal function was normal 4 weeks after discontinuing cefaclor treatment   \n",

Within 2 days the fever abated and the general and respiratory condition of the child improved. However, he complained of abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea on the eighth day of treatment, and cefaclor was withdrawn 2 days later when his temperature rose to 38 degreesC. The child remained upset and anorexic, with pruritus and insomnia. He had a mild erythematous rash on his body, conjunctival jaundice, and swelling of the liver, spleen and glands. At that time, ESR was 11 mm/hr, serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 677 IU (normal 150-470 IU), gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase 43 U/L (normal 1-28 U/L) and total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, cyclomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, and antinuclear-antibody were all negative Urinalysis gave a pH of 6, positive bilirubin and a RBC of 10/HPF.<BR />Although microhematuria lasted for 50 days with 1 episode of macrohematuria, glomerular and tubular functions remained within normal limits and urinary cultures were negative. Liver enzymes returned to normal within 45 days and the child was healthy and well at follow-up.<BR />The sequence of clinical signs and symptoms suggest that the child either had a biphasic or complicated infection, or suffered a hypersensitivity reaction to cefaclor. A drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction seems to explain the course of events better. The appearance of symptoms following exposure to cefaclor and the recession once the drug was withdrawn suggest a cause-effect relationship   \n",

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption.

It was found that despite antibiotic therapy with oral cefaclor 30 mg/kg/d (administered in 3 divided doses) and bronchodilator therapy with procaterol [procaterol hydrochloride] for 7 consecutive days, his respiratory status had progressively deteriorated. On admission, a chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation.&lt;EM&gt; Streptococcus pneumoniae &lt;/EM&gt;urinary antigen was found to be positive. A working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. Therefore, he started receiving IV amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [&lt;EM&gt;dosage not stated&lt;/EM&gt;], unspecified corticosteroids, unspecified bronchodilaters and unspecified mucolytics. On the second day of hospitalisation, he developed an irregular macular rash on the neck, face and trunk and β-lactam antibiotic allergy was suspected.&lt;BR /&gt;The boy was treated with cetirizine [cetirizine hydrochloride]. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced by meropenem.

Four weeks prior to the presentation, he had received cefaclor and and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for three days following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, he developed nausea, cough, diarrhoea and enlargement of right parotid gland. Initial treatment included empirical therapy with levofloxacin. Two days prior to the hospitalisation, he developed chills, rigours along with diarrhoea and cough. His body temperature was 40.0°C. Maculopapular rash was noted on both the arms. During the following 2 days, the rash spread throughout the body including the face and he was admitted. On admission, his body temperature was 37.4°C, HR 120 beats/min, RR 30 breaths/min, BP 87/45mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was noted to have erythematous macules and papules on the entire body along with facial oedema. The Nikolsky sign (blistering on pressure) was negative. The WBC count was 40.4 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;/µL, with 1.5% atypical lymphocytes and 10.5% eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 6.76 mg/dL, ALT 2204 U/mL, AST 1763 U/mL, BUN 74.9 mg/dL and troponin I level was increased to 7.623 ng/mL. All the serological tests were negative. Skin biopsy and histopathology revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocyte infiltrates. An abdomen CT scan demonstrated slight enlargement of the periaortic lymph nodes. He developed profound hypotension and oliguric azotaemia shortly after admission.&lt;BR /&gt;The man received treatment with norepinephrine and was started on haemodialysis. An ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–6. Two days after the admission, reduction in the size of the left ventricular cavity due to oedematous and thickened ventricular wall was evident from echocardiography. Pericardial effusion was also noted along with a diffuse reduction in the left ventricular systolic function. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 52%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome was made. Pericardiocentesis was performed and veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA ECMO) was initiated. Based on the findings and symptoms a definitive diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. On day 3 following admission, the RegiSCAR score was 8. He started receiving treatment with prednisolone, following which cardiogenic shock and rash resolved rapidly. Two days after the initiation of prednisolone (day 5), norepinephrine and VA ECMO were stopped. On repeat echocardiography performed on day 14, marked improvement in the systolic function and myocardial oedema was noted. Haemodialysis was discontinued. One day after the administration of corticosteroids, the ALT and AST levels began decreasing and normalised after 2 months.

He had initially been treated with dexamethasone at a different ward, and was then diagnosed with TEN and transferred. Further investigations revealed that he also had an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month before development of the lesions, which had been treated with doxycycline, cefaclor, cefotaxime and local fusafungine. Additionally, he had been prescribed sulfasalazine for suspected ulcerative colitis a few weeks before TEN onset. He also had a history of taking body-building supplements for a few months 10 years earlier. On admission, he had erythematous lesions on his entire body, with extensive epidermal detachment and positive Nikolsky's sign. Erythematous oedematous, vesicular and bullous lesions were evident on his extremities and abdomen, and extensive erosive mucosal lesions developed.

He received cefaclor on the day of surgery, and oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day. A drug eruption due to cefaclor was suspected and he was switched to levofloxacin.Three days after the first examination, he was re-examined and the erythema on whole body was observed. He had oedematous erythema with no itchiness, which was mainly presented on his torso and lower limbs. On his trunks, a palpable,scattered erythema was observed. He had no fever. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC 8300 /µL (eosinophils 4%, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 8% and monocytes 5%). Histopathology showed liquefaction. However, in the skin lesion necrotic keratinocytes were not detected.<BR />The man received treatment with prednisolone for drug-induced eruption. Initially, his symptoms improved. However, the oedematous erythema eventually resumed spreading. Previously, he had developed drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam, for which he was hospitalised and recovered. His medical history was significant for onychomycosis, for which he had been receiving oral fosravuconazole [fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate] since 41 days. He was also on other concomitant medications. His fosravuconazole treatment was then stopped. The erythema resolved and he continued treatment with prednisolone. After one month of treatment, prednisolone was discontinued. The onychomycosis was treated with efinaconazole solution after discontinuation of fosravuconazole. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was conducted for cefaclor and levofloxacin on day 6 after the drug eruption occurred, and for fosravuconazole on day 20. Stimulation indices for cefaclor, levofloxacin, and fosravuconazole were 97%, 108%, and 189%, respectively. Based on the clinical presentation and various findings, he was diagnosed with cefaclor, levofloxacin and fosravuconazole-induced erythro-papular-type drug eruption. No further recurrence of erythema was observed.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;We report a case of erythro-papular drug eruption caused by [fosravuconazole].&quot; &quot;He had experienced a drug-induced skin eruption with aztreonam.&quot; &quot;He started systemic treatment with cefaclor…oedematous erythema appeared on his body the following day.

Subsequently, he started receiving treatment with cefaclor. Four days during the treatment, his general condition deteriorated and it was observed that he had a fever with associated chills. Thereafter, he started receiving treatment with clindamycin, ibuprofen [Brufen] and ganciclovir in addition to cefaclor. After a day, he had trouble breathing, which worse when lying flat. However, despite these treatments his general condition deteriorated contineously. A chest CT scan revaled multilobar pneumonia, which was more severe on the left upper lobe. Due to his worsening multilobar pneumonia despite treatment with cefaclor, clindamycin, ibuprofen and ganciclovir (lack of efficacy) he was shifted to EICU for further management. After further investigations, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, sepsis, moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) and left ventricular dysfunction.

It was found that despite antibiotic therapy with oral cefaclor 30 mg/kg/d (administered in 3 divided doses) and bronchodilator therapy with procaterol [procaterol hydrochloride] for 7 consecutive days, his respiratory status had progressively deteriorated. On admission, a chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation.<EM> Streptococcus pneumoniae </EM>urinary antigen was found to be positive. A working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. Therefore, he started receiving IV amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [<EM>dosage not stated</EM>], unspecified corticosteroids, unspecified bronchodilaters and unspecified mucolytics. On the second day of hospitalisation, he developed an irregular macular rash on the neck, face and trunk and β-lactam antibiotic allergy was suspected.<BR />The boy was treated with cetirizine [cetirizine hydrochloride]. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced by meropenem. In the following three days, his rash transformed into a confluent maculopapular exanthema with blisters and denudation of the epidermis in large patches that covered large areas (roughly 90%) of the body surface. He developed multiple erosive lesions on the oropharyngeal, anal and ocular mucosa. Additionally, he was dyspnoeic and febrile. He was diagnosed with TEN. He was transferred to paediatric ICU due to hypoxaemia. He underwent noninvasive ventilation and received an unspecified supportive systemic therapy, methylprednisolone, unspecified gamma globulin, unspecified ophthalmic lubricant, plasmapheresis and surgical wound care. His wound swab culture revealed <EM>Acinetobacter baumanii</EM> and <EM>Klebsiella pneumoniae</EM>. Meropenem was replaced by tigeycline and unspecified polymyxins. During the hospitalisation period, he had tachycardia and TEN score was 2 (mild). His skin reepithelialised progressively. Following 14 weeks of the hospitalisation, he was discharged.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;This might suggest that the [toxic epidermal necrolysis] developed in response to [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid], although the immune-related cytotoxic reaction could have been initiated during the initial antibiotic treatment with cefaclor.&quot;   \n",

The female patient, who had acute uncomplicated cystitis, started receiving oral cefaclor 750mg daily for 5−7 days. On the day of cefaclor prescription, she developed nausea. Therefore, cefaclor was discontinued, and the therapy was transitioned to unspecified alternate antibiotic. On the next day of cefaclor discontinuation, nausea disappeared completely.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;With respect to the adverse events related to [cefaclor], as previous studies described low incidence of side effects, only one patient was excluded in this study due to nausea, which disappeared the next day after [cefaclor] discontinuation.&quot;   \n",
       "14  A 33-year-old man developed DRESS syndrome, myocarditis, cardiogenic shock, oliguric azotaemia and liver dysfunction following treatment with cefaclor and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [<EM>dosages and routes not stated; not all times to reaction onsets stated</EM>].<BR />The man presented to hospital with diarrhoea, fever and diffuse maculopapular rash for 2 days. Four weeks prior to the presentation, he had received cefaclor and and an unspecified non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for three days following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, he developed nausea, cough, diarrhoea and enlargement of right parotid gland. Initial treatment included empirical therapy with levofloxacin. Two days prior to the hospitalisation, he developed chills, rigours along with diarrhoea and cough. His body temperature was 40.0°C. Maculopapular rash was noted on both the arms. During the following 2 days, the rash spread throughout the body including the face and he was admitted. On admission, his body temperature was 37.4°C, HR 120 beats/min, RR 30 breaths/min, BP 87/45mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was noted to have erythematous macules and papules on the entire body along with facial oedema. The Nikolsky sign (blistering on pressure) was negative. The WBC count was 40.4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP>/µL, with 1.5% atypical lymphocytes and 10.5% eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 6.76 mg/dL, ALT 2204 U/mL, AST 1763 U/mL, BUN 74.9 mg/dL and troponin I level was increased to 7.623 ng/mL. All the serological tests were negative. Skin biopsy and histopathology revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocyte infiltrates. An abdomen CT scan demonstrated slight enlargement of the periaortic lymph nodes. He developed profound hypotension and oliguric azotaemia shortly after admission.<BR />The man received treatment with norepinephrine and was started on haemodialysis. An ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–6. Two days after the admission, reduction in the size of the left ventricular cavity due to oedematous and thickened ventricular wall was evident from echocardiography. Pericardial effusion was also noted along with a diffuse reduction in the left ventricular systolic function. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 52%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to myocarditis associated with DRESS syndrome was made. Pericardiocentesis was performed and veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA ECMO) was initiated. Based on the findings and symptoms a definitive diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. On day 3 following admission, the RegiSCAR score was 8. He started receiving treatment with prednisolone, following which cardiogenic shock and rash resolved rapidly. Two days after the initiation of prednisolone (day 5), norepinephrine and VA ECMO were stopped. On repeat echocardiography performed on day 14, marked improvement in the systolic function and myocardial oedema was noted. Haemodialysis was discontinued. One day after the administration of corticosteroids, the ALT and AST levels began decreasing and normalised after 2 months. After 5 weeks following corticosteroid administration, the skin rash resolved completely. The dose of corticosteroids was tapered gradually.

She also received vitamin K to normalise her INR and resonium decreased her serum potassium. The hyphaema resolved completely after 48 hours and her right visual acuity had improved to 6/12\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\n&quot;Coagulation studies revealed a supratherapeutic INR of 3.9 and electrolyte analysis revealed elevated serum potassium of 5.9 mEq/L, both of which were deemed iatrogenic secondary to her recent oral antibiotic use..&quot;In conclusion, this is a novel case of an elderly lady with IVTs and subsequent spontaneous hyphaema which in our opinion was likely related to over-anticoagulation and possibly aggravated by sleeping on the ipsilateral side.&quot;   \n",

His symptoms had started after he took oral cefaclor 500mg for pharyngitis. He had an erythematous rash over his entire body and dyspnoea with tremor.<BR />The man received IV methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, ranitidine and epinephrine [adrenaline]. An ECG showed Q waves at the inferior leads, his serum IgE level was 275 IU/mL (normal 5−165) and his C-reactive protein level was 1.1 mg/dL (&#60;0.8). On day 3 of hospitalisation, he complained of chest pain, and an ECG showed negative T waves in the inferior leads. A troponin-I test was positive at 0.77 ng/mL (normal 0.4) and he was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The next day, coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of his right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was unsuccessful. He was diagnosed with late stent thrombosis and an acute coronary syndrome due to Kounis syndrome. An echocardiogram showed akinesia of the middle and apex parts of the inferior wall, and an ejection fraction of 50%. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth day after myocardial infarction.   \n",

She was then lost to follow-up but had continued treatment with prednisone. One year later she presented with diffuse vesiculobullous lesions 20 days after starting cefaclor [<EM>dosage and route not stated</EM>]. On examination she appeared exhausted, wasted and generally ill, with bullae, vesicles and urticarial plaques on her neck, arms, abdomen, back and groin as well as warm, tender, swollen wrist, elbow and knee joints. Laboratory investigations revealed the following values: WBC count 2700/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, platelet count 940 000/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, haemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, ESR 120 mm/h, CRP 17.7 mg/dL and normal complement C3 and C4 levels. Testing also revealed autoimmune thyroiditis with elevated TSH and human antithyroglobulin levels and low free thyroxine.<BR />IgA bullous dermatosis was diagnosed following a skin biopsy and the girl was treated with pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, as well as dapsone and colchicine. Methotrexate was added 1 month postadmission for resistant disease and her lesions started to resolve. She was then referred 9 months postadmission with widespread blistering involving multiple areas of her body and oral ulcers. Investigations revealed normal C4 but low C3 levels and positive results for antihistone and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies; testing for anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant was negative.

During a hospital stay for suspected rheumatoid arthritis, he had received three IM injections of gentamicin, 12 hours apart, for symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection one day before lesion onset. He had initially been treated with dexamethasone at a different ward, and was then diagnosed with TEN and transferred. Further investigations revealed that he also had an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month before development of the lesions, which had been treated with doxycycline, cefaclor, cefotaxime and local fusafungine. Additionally, he had been prescribed sulfasalazine for suspected ulcerative colitis a few weeks before TEN onset. He also had a history of taking body-building supplements for a few months 10 years earlier. On admission, he had erythematous lesions on his entire body, with extensive epidermal detachment and positive Nikolsky's sign. Erythematous oedematous, vesicular and bullous lesions were evident on his extremities and abdomen, and extensive erosive mucosal lesions developed. He became unable to open his eyes, and experienced severe pain. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: ESR of 36 mm/h, CRP 134 mg/L, AST 56 U/L and ALT 175 U/L.<BR />The man received methylprednisolone and was transferred to an ICU. Further treatment included ciclosporin, plasmapheresis with albumin transfusions, and high-dose analgesics. At therapy initiation, epidermal detachment progressed to include 100% of his skin surface area. He developed progressive respiratory insufficiency and septicaemia, and required intubation and ventilation on day 5. Tracheotomy was performed on day 9. He developed blood, skin, and respiratory and urinary tract infections, and started receiving targeted antibiotic therapy; he also received febrifugal and anticoagulant medications, gastric protection, potassium supplements, and enteral and parenteral nutrition. Ophthalmological examination revealed adhesions of the eyelids to his conjunctiva, trichosis, scarring of his eyelid margin and blepharospasm; treatment comprised neomycin ointment, prednisolone and ofloxacin eye drops and artificial tears. His skin lesions began to improve after 7 days of therapy, and further epidermal detachment regressed. Epidermisation was observed over the following days. He was in good condition on discharge after 38 days, with residual soft erythema on his entire body. His skin condition continued to improve during follow-up, but ophthalmological follow-up was indicative of photophobia and dry eye syndrome.\\n\\nAuthor Comment\\nThe first skin lesions appeared in this patient after intramuscular injections of gentamicin… In the period preceding the onset of symptoms, the patient was receiving numerous other drugs that could have contributed to the development of his condition. … The causative factor was difficult to pinpoint.\\n\\nEditorial Comment\\nA search of AdisBase, Medline, Embase and the WHO ADR database did not reveal any previous case reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with fusafungine.   \n",

She had previously taken cefaclor on several occasions.<BR />The woman developed generalised fatigue, declining energy levels and malaise 1 week after taking a 7-day course of cefaclor 250mg 3 times daily. She was also taking conjugated estrogen and ibuprofen. Approximately 1 month later, she developed nausea, night sweats and chills, fleeting stabbing right flank pain and intermittent and vague abdominal and chest discomfort. She also developed gross haematuria that lasted for 7 days before resolving spontaneously.<BR />The woman was evaluated 1 month later and blood tests, urine analysis and the findings of a kidney biopsy were consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. In addition, an abdominal CT scan revealed multiple bilateral solid renal masses. She was treated with a 12-week course of tapering dose prednisone.<BR />At follow-up 1 month after starting treatment with prednisone, the woman's energy level and appetite had started to improve. One month after finishing her course of prednisone, a CT scan revealed normal kidneys and complete resolution of the renal masses and parenchymal displacement. She remained totally asymptomatic and in good health 1 year later.   \n",

Cefaclor was discontinued within 24 hours of admission. The rash improved, but she became lethargic, had a fever (39.4°C) and showed signs of low cardiac output.<BR />The girl's BP was 68/30mm Hg, her pulse rate was 120 beats/min and her respiratory rate was 55 breaths/min. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed an S<SUB>3</SUB> gallop rhythm, and rhonchi at both lung bases. She also had mild metabolic acidosis and a creatinine level of 171 mmol/L. A chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema. An ECG showed inverted T waves and diffused low voltages in leads V<SUB>4</SUB> to V<SUB>6</SUB>. An echocardiogram showed depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%, a shortening fraction of 17% and a shortening velocity of 0.76 circ/sec.<BR />Viral myocarditis was suspected and the girl was intubated and treated with dopamine, adrenaline [epinephrine], nitroprusside, IV methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins. Cardiac catheterisation was performed and revealed a right arterial pressure of 12mm Hg, a main pulmonary artery pressure of 50/28mm Hg and a mean wedge pressure of 32mm Hg. An endomyocardial biopsy showed a predominantly eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate and some focal necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Because histological findings were atypical for viral myocarditis, hypersensitivity myocarditis to cefaclor was suspected.<BR />The girl's clinical condition improved and inotropic support was stopped over the next 5 days.

The appearance of a dark red erythema with numerous pustular eruptions on the trunk, arms and neck area was treated unsuccessfully with oral prednisolone for 7 days. Microscopic examination revealed spongiform pustules of Kogoj.<BR />Withdrawal of all drugs led to a gradual subsidence of eruptions over 3 weeks. Subsequent test dose of both oral cefaclor and acetazolamide resulted in the development of erythematous macules and pustules on the woman's trunk, neck and nape.<BR />'Of particular interest in our patient is the fact that the 2 drugs induced the same exanthema. Because there is no structural resemblance between cefaclor and acetazolamide, it is unlikely that these drugs have a cross-reactivity with each other ...

Treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, chlorpheniramine, epinephrine |adrenaline] and Ringer's lactate. After systolic BP fell further to 30mm Hg, administration of dopamine 20 mcgkg/min increased systolic BP to 94mm Hg. The patient was subsequently discharged from hospital. 10 months later, intradermal skin testing with cefaclor 0.6mcg gave a positive reaction.<BR />Cases 2 and 3: A 51-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman experienced typical anaphylactic reactions after oral cefaclor. Both gave positive reactions to intradermal skin testing with 0.6mcg and 0.6mcg cefaclor, respectively.<BR />Cases 4 and 5: Two men aged 73 and 57 years received cefaclor 250mg and bromhexine (1 tablet), and cefaclor 250mg, respectively. 40 min after drug administration systolic BP fell to 60mm Hg (Case 4); urticaria, dyspnea, cyanosis and stupor were noted after drug intake (Case 5). A positive skin reaction was noted with 0.6mcg intradermal cefaclor in Case 5.<BR />In Japan, of 35,146 patients treated with cefaclor, 5 cases of anaphylaxis have been reported vs 0 of 70,146 cefalexin and 57,970 amoxicillin recipients (p &#60; 0.01). On this basis it has been suggested that cefaclor should not be recommended as first-line therapy and intradermal skin testing be carried out before drug administration   \n",

The patient had also had a presumed urinary tract infection 10 days earlier and was prescribed cefaclor 500mg three times daily changed 2 days later (because of nausea) to IM gentamicin 80mcg daily for 5 days, followed by chloramphenicol 500mcg twice daily for 3 days.<BR />Examination on admission showed the liver was enlarged, there was diffuse abdominal and kidney pain but no dysuria. A percutaneous renal biopsy 3 days after admission demonstrated acute interstitial nephritis. A lymphocyte transformation test revealed an elevated lymphocyte stimulation index for cefaclor. Renal function was normal 4 weeks after discontinuing cefaclor treatment   \n",

Within 2 days the fever abated and the general and respiratory condition of the child improved. However, he complained of abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea on the eighth day of treatment, and cefaclor was withdrawn 2 days later when his temperature rose to 38 degreesC. The child remained upset and anorexic, with pruritus and insomnia. He had a mild erythematous rash on his body, conjunctival jaundice, and swelling of the liver, spleen and glands. At that time, ESR was 11 mm/hr, serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 677 IU (normal 150-470 IU), gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase 43 U/L (normal 1-28 U/L) and total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, cyclomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, and antinuclear-antibody were all negative Urinalysis gave a pH of 6, positive bilirubin and a RBC of 10/HPF.<BR />Although microhematuria lasted for 50 days with 1 episode of macrohematuria, glomerular and tubular functions remained within normal limits and urinary cultures were negative. Liver enzymes returned to normal within 45 days and the child was healthy and well at follow-up.<BR />The sequence of clinical signs and symptoms suggest that the child either had a biphasic or complicated infection, or suffered a hypersensitivity reaction to cefaclor. A drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction seems to explain the course of events better. The appearance of symptoms following exposure to cefaclor and the recession once the drug was withdrawn suggest a cause-effect relationship   \n",
